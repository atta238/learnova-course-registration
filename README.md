# 📚 Learnova – Course Registration System

This is a C++ project that simulates a course registration system for students and administrators. It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and simple data structures to manage courses, grades, and user data.

---

## 📌 Description

The system has two main users:
- **Student**: can register, log in, search and register for courses, check prerequisites, view grades, and generate a report with GPA.
- **Admin**: can log in, upload new courses, set prerequisites, and manage student grades.

The system works with **files only**, not databases. Data is read once at the start and saved at the end.
